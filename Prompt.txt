Here's a detailed summary and plan for your Streamlit app for deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud, designed to capture all main elements of your presentation while making it interactive, informative, and technically impressive—including the option for 3D condenser visualization.

***

## 1. **Project Summary**

- Project Title and Authors (with credits, mentors, and organization logos)
- Brief executive summary section with KPIs (accuracy, time, ROI)
- Context: Tata Motors Harrier Firewall Station, Pimpri-Chinchwad

***

## 2. **Sidebar Navigation**

- Home / Executive Summary
- Context & Problem Statement
- Defect Taxonomy & Sensor Modalities
- AI Mesh Transformer Architecture
- Sensor Placement (interactive diagram/3D view)
- Defect Detection Flow (interactive flowchart)
- ROI Calculator (interactive)
- Implementation Timeline & Milestones
- References

***

## 3. **Key Interactive Elements and Visuals**

### a. **3D Condenser Visualization**
- Use `pythreejs`, `plotly`, or `stpyvista` for 3D rendering (if supported on Community Cloud).
- Display condenser geometry with annotated sensor positions.
- Allow user to select sensor icons; display popup explaining what that sensor detects and its view angle/cover.
- Toggle defects—simulate “bent fin,” “blocked section,” “leak (UV),” etc., as overlays on the 3D model.

### b. **Defect Taxonomy and Modalities Table**
- Expandable/collapsible interactive table.
- Selecting a defect highlights responsible sensor and AI head, and enables sample detection image or animation.

### c. **Mesh Transformer AI Architecture**
- Clear schematic diagram of data/sensor flow.
- Hover/click tooltips explaining each architecture block.

### d. **Defect Detection Flowchart**
- User can step through each stage, with modal popup explaining real-world process at that stage, including time taken and sample output visual.

### e. **ROI Calculator**
- Interactive sliders for initial investment, savings, and O&M cost.
- Auto-update ROI chart and show breakeven month.

### f. **Timeline & Milestones**
- Use Streamlit timeline or Gantt-style visualization
- Show dates, deliverables, current project status

***

## 4. **Informative and Technical Appeal Additions**

- Add “Did you know?” callouts (e.g., “Mesh transformers enable 10x parameter fusion compared to traditional CNNs”)
- Embedded video or animated GIF from YouTube/PPT showing real Harrier assembly or visual detection in action
- Downloadable resources: full presentation, research paper, sample images

## 5. **Streamlit Code Skeleton (for easy copy/paste & deployment)**

    o_and_m = st.slider("Monthly O&M (₹L)", min_value=1, max_value=3, value=1.5)
    # Calculate and plot cumulative ROI (see above chart logic)

# ...Continue for other sections (taxonomy, architecture, flowchart, etc.)...

**Next Steps:**
- Use this structure as a starter for your streamlit app (`streamlit run app.py`) and update placeholders for custom diagrams, images, and videos.
- Let me know if you need full code for specific sections, custom diagrams, or data for 3D models.
- I can provide you with a ZIP including code, assets, and README for instant deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud.

Would you like the **full working code file (.py)** for the Streamlit app including all visuals, or do you want guidance for integrating your own 3D mesh model?
